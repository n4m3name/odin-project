# Intro

## How the course works
- Don't skip any content!
- Take notes that will be usable in the future: Material will be forgotten

## Intro to web dev
**Web dev:** Building, maintaining websites 
- Front-end: Visible content; HTML, CSS, JS
- Back-end: Working content - Stored on server; Java, Python, Ruby, JS
- Full-stack: Both front & back end

**Motivation:** 
People care more about what you've built than how you got there, thus emphasis on projects.

**'Pay it forward':**
It is good practice to start participating in open source projects (even odin project) as you will gain experience, build resume, making you more hirable.

**Focus & attention, pushing through:**
Learning to code is like learning anything else - exciting at first, then as soon as you run into a roadblock it sucks. Expect these roadblocks and stay focused when they come. If you don't force yourself to get through them you won't learn!

**Deliberate practice vs. practice:**
Think of it like playing vs practicing guitar. Come practice time (if you're not careful) you'll 'plateau', sitting around and playing the same 10-15 songs over and over again (at this point it might be time to be more mindful about guitar practice).

Deliberate practice is working on something that is just beyond your current skillset. Since you're a beginner, you should be doing mostly deliberate practice and some reinforcement.

**You always have something to learn:**
- Best practices
- 'Unknown unknowns' & assumptions
- Important but unsexy skills (testing, data modeling, architecture, deployment etc)

## Motivation and mindset (and learning)
It's important to remember why you decided to learn programming & to hold onto this throughout your journey - this gives you a goal to aim for when times are tough.

**Persistence is what gets you through difficult topics:**
Just like learning math, you will get stuck on certain topics. Also like math, you will have to sit down and examine the topic from many angles until it sets in. 

**Learning requires three steps:**
- Understanding (Research)
- Practicing (Projects)
- Teaching (Blog)

**Your brain also has needs:**
Pomodoro allows you to consistently review what you're learning and give your brain (& body) time to catch up. Working too hard for too long leads to burnout, wastes time as you then need to relearn. As tempting as it is, your body is not meant to do anything for 9 hours at a time.

**Your phone is digitally engineered crack:**
...

**Some days you feel like hell:**
These are the days when it is most difficult but simultaneously most important to stay on track. Use known tools to keep moving forwards:
- Schedule set day before
- Journaling/notes
- Breaks/exercise
- Tidy space
- Food

## Asking for help
- Always provide code, surrounding context
- [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/): Ask about the problem, not the solution (i.e. 'How do I do Y' vs 'When I try to do X, Y happens. How can I fix this?')
- Don't be a [help vampire](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/): Figuring out how to fend for yourself is an essential skill.

**Things to do before asking for help:**
- Rubber duck debugging
- [Google search ](https://codinginflow.com/google-programming-questions)

**Checklist for asking for help:**
1. What do you think the problem is?
2. What exactly do you want to happen?
3. What is actually happening?
4. How did you get there?
5. What have you tried so far?
